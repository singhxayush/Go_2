# Go CLI Library Manager
> I want to build a golang's CLI library manager, fetch all libraries from the internet and apply a field for search operation over it in CLI, that with only certain keywords the libraries can be searched and in the cli i want to use TUI to represent the library name beautifully and and a short description of what it can do. when that library i selected, you get multiple options such as: get the library to your local project, read docs, etc etc.

That's a fantastic project idea! Building a Go CLI library manager with a TUI interface would be both useful and visually appealing. Here's a breakdown of how you could approach this project, combining the power of Go, a library index, and the Charm's Bubble Tea library for the TUI:

**1. Library Index and Data:**

* **Source:** You'll need a reliable source for Go library information. Options include:
    * **Go Modules:** Leverage the Go module system itself to fetch package metadata.
    * **Third-Party APIs:** Explore APIs like [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) or [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/) for library descriptions and documentation.
    * **Custom Database:** Create your own database (e.g., using SQLite) to store library data, allowing for more control and offline access.

* **Data Structure:** Design a data structure to represent libraries effectively:

```go
type GoLibrary struct {
    Name        string
    Description string
    URL         string // Link to repository or documentation
    Keywords    []string
    // ... other relevant fields (author, license, etc.)
}
```

* **Fetching and Parsing:** Write Go code to fetch library data from your chosen source and parse it into your data structure.

**2. CLI with Cobra:**

* **Commands:** Use Cobra to define CLI commands:
    * `search [keywords]`: Searches the library index based on keywords.
    * `get [library-name]`: Downloads the specified library to the user's project.
    * `docs [library-name]`: Opens the documentation for the specified library.
    * `list`: Lists all available libraries (potentially paginated).

* **Flags:** Add flags for options like:
    * `--sort`: Sort libraries by name, popularity, etc.
    * `--limit`: Limit the number of search results.

**3. TUI with Bubble Tea:**

* **Model:** Create a Bubble Tea model to represent the state of your application (search results, selected library, etc.).

* **Components:** Use Bubble Tea components to build the TUI:
    * **List:** Display the search results as a scrollable list.
    * **Input:** Allow users to type search queries.
    * **Card:** Show detailed information about the selected library (name, description, keywords).
    * **Buttons:** Provide options for "Get," "Docs," etc.

* **Styling:** Customize the appearance of the TUI using Bubble Tea's styling features.

**4. Library Management:**

* **Downloading:** Implement logic to download libraries using the `go get` command or a dedicated library downloader.
* **Documentation:** Use web browsers or text editors to open library documentation.

**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

```go
// ... (library data fetching and Cobra setup)

type App struct {
    model Model
}

func (a *App) Init() tea.Cmd {
    return nil // No initial commands
}

func (a *App) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case tea.KeyMsg:
        switch msg.String() {
        case "ctrl+c", "q":
            return a.model, tea.Quit
        }
    // ... handle other messages (search input, button clicks)
    }
    return a.model, nil
}

func (a *App) View() string {
    // ... use Bubble Tea components to render the TUI
}

func main() {
    // ... (Cobra setup)

    p := tea.NewProgram(App{})
    if err := p.Start(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error running TUI:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Performance:** Optimize library indexing and search for fast results, especially with a large dataset.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for network requests, file operations, and other potential issues.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests to ensure your code works correctly.


**1. Data Source: Where to Find Library Information**

* **Package Registries:**

   - **Go Modules:** The official Go module system ([https://go.dev/doc/modules](https://go.dev/doc/modules)) is the primary source for Go libraries. You can access information about packages and their metadata through the `go list` command and the Go Proxy ([https://proxy.golang.org/](https://proxy.golang.org/)).

   - **Other Registries:** Explore community-driven registries like [https://pkg.go.dev/](https://pkg.go.dev/) or [https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ThirdParty](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ThirdParty) for additional libraries.

* **Scraping (Use with Caution):**

   - While scraping websites like GitHub or package repositories can provide data, it's generally not recommended as a primary source. Websites change their structure frequently, making your scraper brittle.

   - If you choose to scrape, use ethical practices:
     - Respect `robots.txt` files.
     - Rate-limit your requests to avoid overloading servers.
     - Clearly identify yourself as a bot.

**2. Core Components of Your CLI Library Manager**

* **Data Fetching and Parsing:**

   - **Go Modules:** Use the `go list` command or the Go Proxy API to retrieve package information.
   - **Other Registries:**  Consult their APIs or documentation for data access.
   - **Scraping (if necessary):** Use a Go web scraping library like `goquery` ([https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery)) or `colly` ([https://github.com/gocolly/colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly)).

* **Data Storage:**

   - **In-Memory:** For smaller datasets, store library data in memory using Go structs.
   - **Database:** For larger datasets or persistence, consider using a lightweight database like SQLite or a NoSQL database like BoltDB.

* **Search Functionality:**

   - **Text Matching:** Use Go's built-in string functions (`strings.Contains`, `regexp`) for basic keyword matching.
   - **Fuzzy Matching:** For more sophisticated search, explore libraries like `github.com/agnivade/levenshtein` for fuzzy string comparisons.

* **TUI (Text-Based User Interface):**

   - **Libraries:**
     - **`termbox-go`:** ([https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go)) A low-level TUI library.
     - **`fyne`:** ([https://fyne.io/](https://fyne.io/)) A cross-platform GUI toolkit that can be used for TUIs.
     - **`cursive`:** ([https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)) A more feature-rich TUI library.

* **Library Actions:**

   - **Get Library:** Use `go get` to download and install the selected library into the user's Go project.
   - **Read Docs:** Open the library's documentation in a web browser or display it within the TUI.
   - **Explore Examples:** Provide links to example code or repositories.

**3. Example Code Snippet (Fetching Data with `go list`)**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

func main() {
	// Get a list of packages matching a search term
	cmd := exec.Command("go", "list", "-m", "-json", "github.com/gorilla/mux")
	output, err := cmd.Output()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}

	// Parse the JSON output (you'll need a JSON library like encoding/json)
	fmt.Println(string(output))
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle network issues, API errors, and parsing failures.
* **User Experience:** Design a clear and intuitive TUI that's easy to navigate.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your data fetching, parsing, and search logic.
