This Go documentation outlines the core components and functionalities of the `net/http` package, which is Go's standard library for building web servers and clients.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Request:** Represents an incoming HTTP request from a client. It contains information like the method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and body.
* **Response:** Represents the server's response to a client's request. It includes the status code, headers, and body.
* **Handler:** A function that processes an incoming request and generates a response.
* **ServeMux:** A multiplexer that routes incoming requests to different handlers based on the URL pattern.
* **Server:** A structure that listens for incoming connections and handles requests using a ServeMux or a custom handler.

**Core Functionalities:**

* **Handling Requests:**
    * `Handle` and `HandleFunc`: Register handlers for specific URL patterns.
    * `ServeMux`: A router that maps URL patterns to handlers.
* **Serving Files:**
    * `FileServer`: Serves static files from a directory.
* **Making Requests:**
    * `Get`, `Post`, `Head`: Functions for making HTTP requests to other servers.
* **Client:** A structure for making HTTP requests.
* **Transport:** A structure for customizing how HTTP requests are made (e.g., handling proxies, TLS).

**Advanced Features:**

* **Hijacking:** Taking control of the underlying TCP connection for low-level communication.
* **Pusher:** Sending HTTP/2 push promises to the client.
* **Response Controller:** Provides fine-grained control over the response, including setting deadlines and enabling full duplex communication.

**Examples:**

The documentation includes examples demonstrating how to use these functionalities to build simple web servers, handle file serving, and make HTTP requests.

**Note:**

The documentation also mentions deprecated functionalities, which are marked as such and should be avoided in new code.
